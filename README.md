# ToDo List
My first React Native application. A todo list where you can create and complete tasks.

Technologies I practiced in this project:

- React Native
- Expo
- Javascript

This was my first foray into React Native. I actually enjoy it quite a bit. On first glance, I enjoy React Native a bit more than Android Studio, however, I really wish that I could develop iOS apps more comprehensively on my Windows pc. I feel like I need to buy a Macbook just to practice building iOS apps (which may be by design *shhhh*).

In this application, you can add a task:

![baseScreen](screenshots/baseScreen.png)
![addATask](screenshots/addATask.png)
![listOfTasks](screenshots/listOfTasks.png)

and you can delete a task:

![deleteTasks](screenshots/deleteTasks.png)

In the demo photos, I added 4 tasks, then deleted tasks 2 and 3.
